🔭 I'm experienced IT applications technician and decided to try my hand in the development field.

💻 I have experience in anylizing and troubleshooting issues in SQL Oracle databases, JAVA web applications and delphi/pascal desktop software, especially within the financial industry. 💰 

🎓 Due to graduating JAVA bootcamp last year now I am looking for an opportunities to develop my skills connected to programming areas.
I love to learn and develop both my hard and soft skills. 🙌

During my studies I also explored some of the Python🐍 and frontend basics.
In the December 2020 I have also passed exams for ITIL v4 and DevOps certifications.
